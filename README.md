Actually this is the fourth lab session. In this lab session we learned how to get a CSV file from the given GitHub link. We also learned some essential codes that we use in order to display the CPU information as well as installing GPU. In general with the help of going through this lab, we got to know how to obtain data from various sources for example Kaggle, Google Drive or GitHub and so on. For instance we attempted to obtain mnist csv file from the kaggle. So as a conclusion these are the basic and different functions that we learned to perform in this lab:
• cloning the code from the GitHub
• how to display the file names as well as their content
• how to import files
• how to load and unzip files
• have to display the CVS file using the sklearn as well as installing packages

This is this 5th week lab work. In this lab session we got a massive knowledge regarding basic mathematical operations for example we learned about adding, subtracting, multiplying and other things with the help of tensorflow. At the same time we learnt basically what is the tensorflow and computational graph, constants, placeholders and variables in the tensorflow as well as using some commands to find tensorboard visualization for example histogram and scalar modes. Mainly tensorflow is a library providing various kinds of operations and functionality for deep learning models. It's made of two terms: tanser means representation as a multidimensional array of data; flow means series of operations being performed on the tensor.

This is 6th week lab first session. In this lab we learnt how to get data set plots as a line graph and we tried to add weight to the model as well as layer adding. First we started by installing the right version of tensorflow and then we imported the libraries, defined parameters, creating the data set of linear regression as well as graph plotting, model defining which we want to predict, define its optimizer implement cost function and initialize variables so that we execute the graph by the help of tensorflow session. Then we attempted to denoise an image from dataset by using some filters.
